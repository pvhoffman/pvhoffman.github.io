<p>Per Catherine:  Involve Richard R. more in security releated work, e.g. PCI-S.  For this item I will need to go through the STIG checks returned from the current self-assessment and work with Richard R. to identify work that would be favorible to his strengths.</li>
</p>
<p>Scheduled meeting with Richard R. for Wednesday to discuss RMF workflow and security related material.</p>

<p><strong>Personal</strong></p>
<p>Finished reading <i>Revelation Space</i>, by Alastair Reynolds.  This was a very engaging book with good character development and a good plot, however some of the story made little sense because the decisions made by some of the characters were a bit contrived.</p>
<p>Begin reading <i>Algorithm Design</i>, by Kleinbarg &amp; Tardos. Chapter 1 discusses the Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm. A github repo the the book, with a folder for each chapter containing a discussion and reference implementation would be ideal to display an understanding of that chapter.  This book is fairly long and appears to cover the titled material to a great depth, therefore patience will be key in absorbing and understanding the content of this book.</p>
<p>Kendra suggested that I begin the INN cirriculum she is taking so that her and I are aligned and can better pursue something together having this alignment.  I think this is a good idea and I will commit time during the week to absorb the course material.</p>
