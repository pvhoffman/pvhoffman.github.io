I'm struggling with the decision to seriously attempt to find work elsewhere or to continue with my current position. My current position requires significantly more 'soft' skils, i.e. people skills, which isn't altogether a bad thing but I'm stagnating in another area which is important to me:  learning new technical sills and excercising existing ones.  My immediate superviser/boss is the primary reason for wanting to remain in my current position however I must not think that her presence is a guarantee; she may willingly or unwillingly leave here after which I would have little to no reason to remain.  To this end I can reason that it would be wise to seek livelihood elsewhere.

Identifying and quantifying accomplishments for the purpose of improving my CV has proven difficult, not becasue I've accomplished little.  Perhaps this is because equating regular work with an accomplishment is difficult, or better yet foreign, to me.  If this is the case then going through my email to harvest 'accomplishments' should be trivial.
